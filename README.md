# StudySync â€“ A React Native Study Planner App

## Project Overview

**StudySync** is a productivity-focused mobile application designed to help students organize, track, and manage their academic tasks and study sessions. Developed using **React Native**, the app integrates essential mobile development principles covered in our courseâ€”including components, navigation, state management, and persistent storage.

This project is part of a team assignment focused on creating a fully functional React Native application that demonstrates each member's contributions while implementing core mobile app development concepts.

## Key Features

- **Task Management (CRUD)**  
  Create, view, update, and delete study tasks with essential metadata like subject, due date, and priority.

- **Dashboard & Daily Progress Tracker**  
  Visual overview of today's study schedule with a progress bar to track task completion.

- **Persistent Storage with AsyncStorage**  
  All user tasks and progress are saved using AsyncStorage, ensuring data is preserved between sessions.

- **Responsive UI & Intuitive Navigation**  
  Smooth navigation between screens using the React Navigation library, with a clean and user-friendly interface.
